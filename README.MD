<h1><b> What is Ethical Hacking? </h1></b>
<h2><i> The term hacking goes a long way back. To be exact, it all started at the Railroad Club of MIT, where both the term â€˜hackingâ€™ and â€˜hackerâ€™ were first coined. Itâ€™s been almost 50 years now, and hacking has evolved into a discipline in the current day and age. With the increase in awareness regarding data protection and data privacy, hacking has been deemed as an illegal activity today. If caught, thereâ€™s a good chance that you will be prosecuted for quite some time depending on the degree of harm caused.

None the less, to protect themselves from hackers of all sorts, employment of Ethical Hackers has become a common practice amongst organizations. Ethical hackers are given the responsibility of finding and fixing security flaws for a certain organization before black hat hackers find them. </h2></i><br>

<h1><b>What is Python?</h1></b>
<h2><i>Python is a general-purpose scripting language that has gained immense popularity amongst professionals and beginners for its simplicity and powerful libraries. Python is insanely versatile and can be used for almost any kind of programming. From building small scale scripts that are meant to do banal tasks, to large scale system applications â€“ Python can be used anywhere and everywhere. In fact, NASA actually uses Python for programming their equipment and space machinery. 

Python can also be used to process text, display numbers or images, solve scientific equations, and save data. In short, Python is used behind the scenes to process a lot of elements you might need or encounter on your devices.</h2></i><br>

#
<h1><b> Why Python?</h1></b>
<h2><i> Python has gained its popularity mostly because of its super powerful yet easy to use libraries. Sure Python has awesome readability and it is really simple and all but nothing really beats the fact your job as a developer is made super simple with these libraries. These libraries find uses in all sorts of domains, for example, artificial intelligence has Pytorch and Tensorflow while Data Science has Pandas, Scapy, Numpy, Matplotlib.</h2></i><br>

#
<h1><b>Why hackers should learn Python for pen testing</h1></b>
<h2><i>Python is used among hacking professionals for its powerful and user-friendly libraries. It provides readability and simplicity, which can help you complete your tasks more quickly and easily. Python libraries are also used for code-cracking, decoding, network scanning, and even network attacks.</h2></i><br>

<h1><b>Python Libraries for Ethical Hacking</h1></b>

<h2><i>Python is vastly popular because of its super-powerful yet easy-to-use libraries that are easily available to developers. Despite the fact that Python comes with minimal syntax and awesome readability, but nothing beats the fact that developerâ€™s lives get really simple with these libraries which are available in all sorts of domains, for example, artificial intelligence has PI touch intensive loop while data science has pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. Here are some of the top 7 Python libraries used for hacking and each one has its unique identification and function.</h2></i><br></br>

<h2><b>1. Requests</h2></b>

<h3><i>The requests library helps one to allow HTTP requests to be more user-friendly. It returns responsive objects including data of status, encoding, and content. It is a module that can be used to send all kinds of HTTP requests it is very easy to use and has features like passing parameters in the URL and passing custom headers as well. It is a human-friendly HTTP library as it also suggests on the official documentation page as well and it is one of the most downloaded Python libraries with more than 400,000 downloads every day. Python requests are so popular because developers donâ€™t have to manually add the queries to the URLs and form encode post data and that is reason enough to use Python requests.</h3></i><br>

<h2><b>2. Cryptography</h2></b>

<h3><i>Cryptography is a library that helps with encryption as well as the description of sets of data. The library includes primitives supported by Python 3.3+, Python 2.6-2.7. Cryptography involves the amalgamation of two layers that is, namely safe cryptographic recipes that require minimum configuration choices. While another one is low-level cryptography which is most dangerous and can be used incorrectly. This python library helps to secure information with the help of effectively developed codes. Cryptography includes the generation of random numbers, digital signatures, hashing, stream ciphers, and hashing.</h3></i><br>

<h2><b>3. Python-Nmap</h2></b>

<h3><i>Nmap is a typical network scanner tool using IP packets for the identification of devices on a network and information regarding operating systems. With the use of the Nmap port scanner, this library helps the system administrators automate the task for scanning reports supporting the Nmap scripts outputs. Nmap helps to identify and discover hosts on networks and detects the version number, application name functioning on any remote devices.</h3></i><br>

<h2><b>4. Impacket</h2></b>

<h3><i>The library consists of Python scripts that aids with working on network protocols, it ensures low-level programming access to other packets along with the implementation of the protocols. Packets can be made out of raw data, and the API makes deep hierarchies protocols work efficiently. Impacketâ€™s goal is to make tasks easier for programmers so that they can work under a framework while abiding by some custom protocols.</h3></i><br>

<h2><b>5. Scapy</h2></b>

<h3><i>The tool to manipulate network packets, helping with discovering networks, probing, tracing, routing, and scanning. Scapy includes diverse functionalities apart from packet sniffing and can be customized as peruse. It can be run on Linux, Mac OS, and windows. It presents decoded packets with the interpretation depending on the user. Scapy works to bring semblance between high leveled protocols and low-level networks programming.</h3></i><br>

<h2><b>6. RawSocketPy</h2></b>

<h3><i>A layer 2 python library that encourages communication with MAC addresses. One can create custom-made WiFi communication using rawsocketpy. A non-simultaneous server with an uptight capability with no encryption needs an MTU of 1500. Rawsocketpy does not involve transmission control protocol or user datagram protocol.</h3></i><br>

<h2><b>7. Pylibnet</h2></b>

<h3><i> A libnet packet injection library ensures functionality for sending packets, presentation of libcap traces along with having a python API for libnet packets. These are some of the python libraries holding an efficacy under ethical hacking. Python language is used by tech companies because of its versatility and secure algorithms. Python gained much popularity in the last few decades. It has been used by a lot of developers, hackers of big companies because of its easy-to-understand and general-purpose syntax that can be applied to a large number of programming domains. There are countless python libraries available on the web, but the ones listed above are best suited for ethical hacking.</h3></i><br>
